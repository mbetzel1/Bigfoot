Thanks to the BFRO for the data.
Thanks to RIT Visual Analytics course for assigning the project.
I used Google Charts and d3.js so thank them as well.
I will be honest, the codes a bit of a mess. Definitely need to refactor some things and add some bells and whistles, but it certainly satisfies the project requirements.
